//! [`AllocCore`] — the single-threaded allocator over the self-hosted segment
//! substrate (Phase 8, `alloc-core` feature).
//!
//! This is the **Cartographer** of the segment substrate: all placement logic
//! (which size class, which page, free-list pop/push, large/huge routing) is
//! **pure safe integer arithmetic** over segment-relative offsets and
//! size-class indices. Every raw memory touch is delegated to the [`node`](node)
//! seam; every OS reservation to the [`os`](os) seam. `AllocCore` itself
//! contains NO `unsafe` and NO `Vec`/`Box`/`HashSet`/`std::alloc` — the alloc
//! path is therefore **reentrancy-free (M5)**: it cannot recurse into the
//! global allocator because it allocates no metadata through it.
//!
//! ## API
//!
//! - [`AllocCore::new`] — bootstrap the primordial segment (the ONLY place
//!   that hand-carves self-hosted metadata; see [`bootstrap`]).
//! - [`alloc`](AllocCore::alloc) / [`dealloc`](AllocCore::dealloc) /
//!   [`realloc`](AllocCore::realloc) / [`alloc_zeroed`](AllocCore::alloc_zeroed)
//!   — the single-threaded allocator entry points. `alloc`/`alloc_zeroed`
//!   are **safe** `pub fn`s; `dealloc`/`realloc` are **`unsafe fn`s** (R6-MS-1/2)
//!   carrying a `# Safety` contract that mirrors `GlobalAlloc`'s — a
//!   well-behaved caller passes a valid prior pointer/layout (verify with
//!   `grep -n "pub unsafe fn dealloc\|pub unsafe fn realloc" src/alloc_core/alloc_core.rs`).
//!   The crate's former posture was a safe `pub fn` with a defensive **M2
//!   contract at runtime** (a foreign or already-freed pointer degraded to a
//!   no-op); that was reversed after the round5 `memory_safety_review` produced
//!   concrete safe-Rust counterexamples proving the defensive checks
//!   insufficient — see [`dealloc`](AllocCore::dealloc)'s `# Safety` section
//!   for the full rationale and exploit catalogue, and `CHANGELOG.md`
//!   (R6-MS-1/2) for the migration. The M2 defensive paths are RETAINED as
//!   defence-in-depth. None of the entry points panic or recurse.
//!
//! ## Single-threaded
//!
//! Phase 8 is single-threaded (correctness before concurrency — §5 P8).
//! Per-thread heaps + lock-free cross-thread free are Phase 9/10. `AllocCore`
//! is `Send` (it owns its segments, which are `Send`) but NOT `Sync`.

// (mmap/VirtualAlloc + munmap/VirtualFree). mimalloc avoids this by keeping a
// per-allocator page-cache of recently-freed large spans so the next alloc of
// the same size hits the cache instead of the OS (~800 ns vs ~8–240 µs).
//
// We implement a MINIMAL version: a fixed array of LARGE_CACHE_SLOTS entries.
// The cache is ONLY active under `alloc-decommit` (it uses `table.recycle` for
// the slot-NULL step, which is only compiled with that feature; this keeps the
// logic consistent with the decommit-gate on the small-segment recycle path).

///    `large_cache` entries) and has no `unsafe impl Sync for AllocCore`
///    anywhere in this crate (verified by grep at the time of writing) — so

//! [`SegmentTable`] — the global registry of all live segments, SELF-HOSTED in
//! the primordial segment's payload (not a `Vec` / `Box` on the global
//! allocator).
//!
//! This is the keystone of the Phase 8 Membrane Inversion (§1 of
//! `MALLOC_PLAN.md`): the safe slot-table discipline stops *consuming* memory
//! (via `Vec`/`HashSet`) and starts *governing* it. The registry lives inside
//! the very segments it tracks, so the alloc path can mutate it without ever
//! calling the global allocator (M5 — reentrancy-freedom).
//!
//! ## Design
//!
//! - A fixed-capacity array of segment-base pointers, carved from the
//!   primordial segment at a known offset. Capacity is bounded by
//!   [`MAX_SEGMENTS`] — sufficient for the single-threaded Phase 8 surface
//!   (each large/huge allocation is its own segment; small allocations pack
//!   many per segment). Phase 9+ may grow this dynamically (still self-hosted)
//!   if a workload genuinely needs more.
//! - `segment_count` tracks how many entries are live. `drop` walks the table
//!   and frees every segment EXCEPT the primordial (which is freed last, after
//!   the table itself is no longer needed — special-cased by `AllocCore::drop`).
//! - O(1) `segment_of(ptr) = ptr & ~(SEGMENT-1)` lives in [`super::os`] and
//!   yields the segment base; routing then reads the header at offset 0. The
//!   table is only needed for census/drop, not the hot path.
//!
//! ## Safety
//!
//! The table is plain data (a `*mut u8` array + a count) laid down in segment
//! memory; mutation goes through the [`node`](super::node) seam's pointer
//! writes for the slots. The bootstrap (`super::bootstrap`) is the ONLY place
//! that hand-writes the table in place before the safe Cartographer takes over.

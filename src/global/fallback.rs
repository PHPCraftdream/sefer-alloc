//! The primordial fallback heap (Phase 12.3, §2.3 of
//! `ALLOC_PLAN_PHASE12-13.md`).
//!
//! A process-global, always-live [`HeapCore`] for the **pre-TLS** (very
//! early runtime init, before any thread's TLS is set up) and **post-TLS-
//! teardown** windows. The alloc face routes here when [`tls_heap::current`]
//! cannot serve a thread-local heap; the fallback is therefore the
//! embodiment of **M10 — never-null when serviceable**: the alloc face
//! returns null only on true OOM, never because "no heap is bound right
//! now".
//!
//! ## Correctness, not speed
//!
//! These windows are rare (early runtime init before the first thread's TLS
//! is wired; the dying moments of thread teardown). A simple spinlock-guarded
//! heap is fine — contention is essentially impossible (the runtime is
//! single-threaded in the pre-TLS window, and a tearing-down thread is
//! exiting). We do NOT use `std::sync::Mutex` (it may allocate on some
//! platforms on contention); a hand-rolled `AtomicBool` spinlock is M5-clean
//! (no `std::alloc` reachable).
//!
//! ## Never dropped
//!
//! The fallback [`HeapCore`] lives in a `static MaybeUninit` and is NEVER
//! dropped. Its segments stay mapped for the process lifetime. This is
//! intentional and correct: the fallback serves allocations that may
//! outlive any single thread, and dropping it would unmap memory a late
//! `dealloc` may still target. The bounded leak (one heap's footprint) is
//! the price of the never-null guarantee.
//!
//! ## Blocks are normal segment blocks
//!
//! Blocks allocated from the fallback are normal segment blocks — their
//! owning segment's header carries `owner_thread_free` set to the fallback
//! heap's TFS head (under `alloc-xthread`). So a later cross-thread free
//! routes correctly via `segment_base_of` → header owner, no special-casing
//! on the free path. Under plain `alloc-global` (no `alloc-xthread`) the
//! blocks are own-thread-only (the fallback is single-threaded anyway in
//! that config).
//!
//! ## M5-clean bootstrap
//!
//! The fallback's [`HeapCore::new`] goes through the OS aperture
//! (`mmap`/`VirtualAlloc`) and never `std::alloc` — same M5-clean property
//! as the registry bootstrap. Under `alloc-xthread`,
//! [`HeapCore::install_thread_free`] does NOT allocate: since the 12.5
//! redesign its body is a no-op that merely hands out the address of the
//! heap's already-initialised (in `new`) inline `thread_free` field. (A real
//! `Box`-via-`std::alloc` here would self-deadlock — the first fallback alloc
//! runs under the fallback spinlock, and re-entering the global allocator to
//! grow a `Box` would recurse back into it.) There is thus no first-alloc
//! `Box` and no OOM-on-install case to handle: cross-thread-free routing is
//! wired purely from the stable inline field, M5-clean and M10-preserving.
//!
//! [`tls_heap::current`]: super::tls_heap::current

// The crate is `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` with `alloc-global` on (see
// `src/lib.rs`); this is the documented fallback-heap seam (Phase 12.3).
// `allow` lifts the crate-level `deny` for this file only. The `unsafe`
// surface here is:
//   * the hand-rolled atomic-init state-machine over a `static mut
//     MaybeUninit<HeapCore>` (mirrors the registry's bootstrap discipline),
//     and
//   * the spinlock-guarded `&mut HeapCore` handout (sound under the
//     spinlock's mutual exclusion).
// Every `unsafe` block carries a `// SAFETY:` proof.

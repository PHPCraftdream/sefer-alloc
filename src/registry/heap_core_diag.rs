//! Diagnostics / test-only hooks for [`HeapCore`] (mechanical split of
//! `heap_core.rs`, task R4-10).
//!
//! This file holds the `impl HeapCore { .. }` block for the inspection
//! test hooks (`dbg_owner_id_for`, `dbg_tcache_count`, etc.).
//! Pure code-movement sibling of `heap_core.rs`; no behavior changed.

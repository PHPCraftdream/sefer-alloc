//! [`HeapCore`] — the thin heap value that lives inside a registry slot.
//!
//! This is the type the Phase 12.3 raw-pointer TLS caches as
//! `*mut HeapCore`. Per §2.0 of `ALLOC_PLAN_PHASE12-13.md` the heap is now
//! thin (segment-centric free state lives in each segment's `BinTable`, not
//! in a heap-local array), so the per-slot heap needs to carry only:
//!
//! - its **id** (its slot index + the slot's `generation`), used by the 12.3
//!   ownership stamping on segment headers (`owner = heap id + generation`)
//!   and the M8/M9 coherence checks, and
//! - the **segment substrate** ([`AllocCore`]) that owns this heap's segments
//!   and performs all per-segment `BinTable` arithmetic.
//!
//! ## Phase 12.3 — allocation routes through `HeapCore`
//!
//! 12.3 wires `HeapCore::alloc`/`dealloc`/`realloc`/`alloc_zeroed` as the
//! entry points the raw-pointer TLS binding hands to the alloc face. They
//! delegate to the [`AllocCore`] (own-thread path). Under `alloc-xthread`,
//! [`HeapCore`] also carries the cross-thread `ThreadFreeStack` handle and
//! stamps `owner_thread_free` on segment headers so remote threads can route
//! cross-thread frees here (the §2.2 "owner stamping — 12.3" rule).
//!
//! ## M5-clean bootstrap invariant
//!
//! `HeapCore::new` bootstraps via [`AllocCore::new`] (OS aperture only —
//! `mmap`/`VirtualAlloc`, **never** `std::alloc`) and allocates NOTHING
//! else. In particular the cross-thread free-stack head is **not** an inline
//! `HeapCore` field and is **not** `Box`-allocated: task H1 hoisted it OUT of
//! `HeapCore` into the OWNING [`HeapSlot::thread_free`] (a `Sync`,
//! process-`'static` slot field, null-initialised in the registry bootstrap's
//! zeroed pages) — see the [`thread_free`](HeapCore::thread_free) field doc for
//! the full aliasing-gap rationale (a remote CAS onto an inline head would land
//! inside the owner's protected `&mut HeapCore` retag range). `HeapCore::new`
//! therefore leaves its [`thread_free`](HeapCore::thread_free) handle `None`;
//! the stable `&'static` handle to that slot word is planted right after the
//! slot binds by [`bind_thread_free`](HeapCore::bind_thread_free) — called from
//! `HeapRegistry::claim`, or from `fallback::heap_ptr` with `&FALLBACK_TFS` for
//! the standalone fallback heap. Because resolving that handle allocates
//! nothing, the bootstrap stays M5-clean (no `std::alloc` reach) and the
//! `#[global_allocator]` bind-path recursion an eager `Box::new` would have
//! caused remains impossible. In the transient pre-bind window
//! (`thread_free == None`, never observed on any alloc/free path) the heap
//! serves only own-thread allocations — cross-thread frees to its segments are
//! a safe no-op, matching the existing unstamped-segment behaviour in
//! `dealloc_small`.
//!
//! [`HeapSlot::thread_free`]: super::heap_slot::HeapSlot::thread_free
//!
//! ## `HeapCore` — the sole allocator face
//!
//! `HeapCore` is the slot-resident value the registry stores and the raw-
//! pointer TLS caches. The malloc face (`SeferAlloc`) routes through `HeapCore`
//! via the registry. (An earlier `Heap`/`with_heap` public face existed in
//! 0.3.0–0.3.x as a thin `AllocCore` wrapper without the magazine; it was
//! removed in 0.3.x — never used by the production fast path, ~9–12x slower
//! than mimalloc per `docs/HEAP_BENCH.md`. `HeapCore` is the magazine-backed
//! successor that supersedes it entirely.)

// TEST-ONLY (0.3.0, task C1 → 0.4.x task #133): magazine (tcache) HIT
// counter. Originally a single process-wide `static AtomicU64`, bumped by
// EVERY thread's alloc fast path — a contended `lock xadd` on an otherwise
// fully per-thread hot path (the "churn hot path": pop from the magazine).
// Under MT this counter's cache line ping-pongs across cores on every
// magazine hit, adding cross-core traffic to a path that is architecturally
// per-thread (each `HeapCore` lives on one thread's registry slot — see the
// module doc). Perf regression #133.
//
// Fix: the counter is now a PER-HEAP field (`HeapCore::tcache_hits`, see
// below), incremented by its own owning thread only. Two threads' counters
// never share a cache line (each lives inside its own slot in the
// `'static` registry array), so the increment is a plain (uncontended)
// atomic RMW on ST and has NO cross-core traffic on MT — the contention is
// eliminated, not just made cheaper.
//
// It stays an `AtomicU64` (not a plain `u64`) because the process-global
// VIEW (`tcache_hits()` below, and `SeferAlloc::stats().tcache_hits`) reads
// EVERY live heap's counter from whatever thread calls `stats()` — a
// different thread than the owner in general. A plain `u64` written by one
// thread and read by another without synchronisation is a data race (UB,
// caught by TSan); `Relaxed` on both sides keeps this sound (no ordering
// requirement on a diagnostic counter — see the crate's existing
// `DBG_LARGE_XTHREAD_RECLAIMED` for the same relaxed-diagnostic pattern)
// while remaining `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`-clean (no seam module needed —
// `AtomicU64` is safe-Rust top to bottom).
//
// TASK W3 (0.3.0) — the counter STORAGE moved out of `HeapCore` and into the
// owning `HeapSlot` (`HeapSlot::tcache_hits`), closing a formal aliasing gap.
// The old design put the `AtomicU64` INSIDE `HeapCore`; the process-wide
// aggregator (`tcache_hits_total`) then materialised a shared `&HeapCore`
// (`(*heap_ptr).tcache_hits()`) over a struct the OWNING thread concurrently
// holds a protected `&mut` into (the `alloc(&mut self, …)` protector) — a
// foreign-read of a protected `Unique`, UB under Stacked Borrows. Storing the
// counter in the `HeapSlot` (which is `Sync`, designed to be shared, and
// already read by the aggregator via `&HeapSlot` for `initialised`) lets the
// aggregator read it WITHOUT any `&HeapCore`. The owner reaches its slot's
// counter through the stable `*const AtomicU64` in the field below, planted by
// `HeapRegistry::claim` right after the slot is bound. See

// RAD-4 (Phase 4, E3a) — overflow-safe cross-thread small-block free.
//
// `RemoteFreeRing::push` (a per-segment, bounded MPSC queue — see that
// module's docs) returns `Err(PushOverflow)` when its `RING_CAP = 256` slots
// are all reserved-but-undrained. Before this task, BOTH push call sites in
// `dealloc_foreign_slow` below discarded that error (`let _ = ring.push(..)`)
// — a single overflow is a documented, sound, BOUNDED leak (the block stays
// mapped but unused), but a SUSTAINED producer→consumer fan-in (many remote
// threads freeing into one owner faster than the owner drains) turns that
// into an UNBOUNDED cumulative logical leak: every subsequent overflow drops
// another block, permanently, and `live_count` never returns to zero, which
// blocks `alloc-decommit` from ever releasing the segment.
//
// The ring's own push/drain/cursor protocol is NOT touched by this fix (out
// of scope per the RAD-4 task boundary, and the ring itself is fully sound —
// see `docs/RACE_DRAIN_RECLAIM.md`). Closing the leak at the SMALLEST
// protocol delta instead means changing what the CALLER does with
// `Err(PushOverflow)`: retry, rather than drop.
//
// ## Why retry (not a new Treiber stack of block-payload nodes)
//
// The plan's own precedent for a heap-level MPSC fallback is `abandoned_segs`
// / the A1 deferred-large-free stack (`HeapCore::thread_free`, reused as a
// Treiber-stack head over segment BASES, chained through each segment's own
// `next_abandoned` header field — see that field's doc comment). That idiom
// works because A1's payload IS a segment identity (the whole segment is the
// thing being queued) — no separate node storage is needed beyond the
// segment's own pre-reserved header bytes.
//
// This case is different: the lost item is one FREED BLOCK's `(offset,
// class)` pair, not a segment. Durably queuing that payload elsewhere would
// need one of:
//   - writing into the block's own bytes — reopens EXACTLY the H1-class UAF
//     this ring was built to close (see the module doc on
//     `RemoteFreeRing`: "a cross-thread freer never touches the block's
//     bytes" is the ring's core soundness argument);
//   - a new slot-resident (`HeapSlot`) head field, wired through
//     `HeapRegistry::claim`'s `bind_slot_counters` — out of this task's file
//     scope (`heap_registry.rs` is owned by a parallel task in this
//     session), and, independently, still needs per-BLOCK node storage
//     behind that head, which in turn needs either `Box::new` (the exact
//     `#[global_allocator]` reentrancy hazard `HeapCore`'s own module doc
//     warns against — "M5-clean bootstrap invariant") or a second in-segment
//     array (a `RemoteFreeRing`-shaped structure in a NEW location — a
//     segment-metadata layout change, explicitly out of scope for E3a: see
//     the implementation plan's Phase 4 vs. the gated, higher-risk Phase 7
//     dirty-segment queue);
//   - reusing `next_abandoned` for LIVE Small segments too (it is unused
//     while a Small segment is live) — rejected: the UB audit already flags
//     `next_abandoned` sharing between `abandoned_segs` and A1 as a latent,
//     documented reactivation hazard (Finding 5 / M-7 in
//     `docs/reviews/2026-07-10-ub-audit-registry.md`); adding a THIRD
//     consumer of the same link field on LIVE segments widens that hazard's
//     blast radius instead of leaving it exactly as dormant as it is today.
//
// Retrying the push needs none of that: it adds no new struct, no new
// header field, no new slot wiring, and never touches block bytes or the
// ring's own cursor arithmetic. It is sound-by-construction (the ring stays
// exactly as correct as it already is) and closes the leak as long as the
// owner keeps draining — which it does on every `alloc()` call via
// `find_segment_with_free`'s lazy per-segment ring drain, the SAME liveness
// assumption every lazy-drain path in this allocator already relies on.
//
// ## Bound, not infinite spin
//
// An unconditionally infinite retry would make `dealloc()` able to block
// forever if the owner thread stops allocating entirely while producers are
// still freeing into it — a much bigger behavioural change for a
// `GlobalAlloc` face than this task's "smallest protocol delta" mandate
// accepts. `RING_PUSH_RETRY_SPINS` bounds the retry to a generous but finite
// number of `core::hint::spin_loop()`-paced attempts (the same spin-hint
// idiom already used by `global::fallback::LockGuard`/`bootstrap`'s
// init-state spin). Within that bound, ANY owner drain (which empties up to
// the full `RING_CAP = 256` slots in one pass) reopens enough room for the
// retry to succeed — so the bound only matters for a truly pathological,
// sustained-overflow workload; the `remote_fanin` harness
// (`tests/remote_fanin.rs`) is the empirical judge of whether this bound is
// generous enough in practice. If the bound is exhausted, the push still
// falls back to the original, documented-sound bounded leak (dropped, both
// `RemoteFreeRing`'s own `DBG_RING_OVERFLOW`/per-segment `overflow_count`
// tick as before) — `DBG_RING_PUSH_RETRY_EXHAUSTED` (below) counts ONLY
// this genuinely-unrecovered case, distinct from `DBG_RING_OVERFLOW` (which
// ticks on every individual full-ring push ATTEMPT, including ones a retry
// goes on to recover).
// Under miri (interpreted execution, orders of magnitude slower than
// native), the full retry budget makes an overflow-heavy test impractically
// slow — a single genuinely-exhausted retry loop at the native bound was
// measured to make `cargo +nightly miri test` on `tests/remote_fanin.rs`
// not finish in a reasonable time. `#[cfg(miri)]` narrows the bound to a
// small but still-meaningful value (large enough to exercise the loop body,
// the atomic CAS retry, and both counter-increment branches; small enough
// for miri's interpreter to reach retry exhaustion in a bounded test)
// WITHOUT changing the retry protocol/logic itself — the exact same idiom
// `alloc_core_small.rs`/`bootstrap.rs` already use elsewhere in this crate
// for miri-only initialisation gates (`grep -rn 'cfg(miri)' src/`), applied
// here to a workload-size constant instead. Real (non-miri) builds are

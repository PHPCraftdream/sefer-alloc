## Install

```toml
[dependencies]
sefer-alloc = { version = "0.3", features = ["production"] }
```

Or via cargo:

```sh
cargo add sefer-alloc --features production
```

The `production` feature is the recommended set for any long-running
multi-thread or async workload. It is shorthand for
`alloc-global + alloc-xthread + alloc-decommit + fastbin` — the drop-in
`GlobalAlloc` face, lock-free cross-thread free, OS page decommit, and
the per-thread fast-bin magazine. Without `alloc-decommit` the
`SegmentTable`'s slot-recycle is off and the 1024-segment ceiling
becomes a hard cap.

For the bare `no_std` + `alloc` handle-store core, see
[Two faces](#two-faces) below; for the full feature matrix, see
[Features matrix](#features-matrix).

---

## Basic usage

Drop-in `#[global_allocator]` — three lines, zero configuration. Every
`Vec` / `Box` / `String` / `HashMap` allocation in your process
(including those made by `tokio`, `rayon`, `serde_json`, etc.) goes
through `sefer-alloc`.

```rust
use sefer_alloc::SeferAlloc;

#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: SeferAlloc = SeferAlloc::new();

fn main() {
    let v: Vec<u8> = (0..1024).map(|i| i as u8).collect();
    println!("vector of {} bytes", v.len());
}
```

`SeferAlloc::new()` uses defaults tuned for throughput-first workloads
(unbounded large-cache, 256 MiB headroom, 1 s decay interval, 10 %
decay rate, event-driven mode). For RSS-sensitive or container
deployments, see [Configuration](#configuration) below.

---

## Configuration

For RSS-bounded servers, containers, or any deployment where you want
to cap how much memory the allocator holds onto, use
`SeferAlloc::with_config(...)`. Every builder method is `const fn`,
so the config lives in a `static` initialiser and is resolved at
compile time — zero runtime overhead, no env vars, no parse errors.

```rust
use sefer_alloc::{SeferAlloc, LargeCacheConfig, LargeCacheMode};

const CONFIG: LargeCacheConfig = LargeCacheConfig::new()
    .budget_bytes(512 * 1024 * 1024)      // 512 MiB hard ceiling per shard
    .headroom_bytes(64 * 1024 * 1024)     //  64 MiB anti-thrash floor
    .decay_interval_ms(200)               // 200 ms between decay ticks
    .decay_rate_percent(25)               //  25 % of excess released per tick
    .mode(LargeCacheMode::Lazy);          // event-driven (no background thread)

#[global_allocator]
static GLOBAL: SeferAlloc = SeferAlloc::with_config(CONFIG);
```

### Parameters

| Method | Default | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `.budget_bytes(N)` | `None` (unbounded) | Per-shard hard ceiling on total cached bytes. Set to your container's RSS limit. FIFO eviction fires before admitting a new span that would exceed the limit. `0` ⇒ cache disabled (nothing is cached). |
| `.headroom_bytes(N)` | `256 MiB` | Anti-thrash floor — the decay step does NOT release bytes below this level. Higher headroom = more memory retained between ticks (less aggressive trimming). |
| `.decay_interval_ms(N)` | `1000` ms | Minimum wall-clock interval between consecutive decay ticks. A tick computes `excess = cached − headroom` and releases `excess × rate` back to the OS. |
| `.decay_rate_percent(N)` | `10` % | Fraction of the excess released per tick, integer percent in `[1, 100]` (clamped). `10` ⇒ release 10 % per tick (self-damping exponential decay); `100` ⇒ flush all excess in one tick. |
| `.mode(M)` | `Lazy` | Decay trigger. **`Lazy`** — event-driven: each large alloc/free checks if the interval has elapsed; if so, one decay step runs inline. No background thread, idle process pays nothing. **`Background` / `Both`** — reserved for a future background scavenger; in 0.1 they fall back to `Lazy`. |

The model is **"allocate fast, release slowly"**: each tick removes a
constant fraction of the current excess, so the cache approaches the
headroom aggressively when far above it and gently when near it —
self-damping, no oscillation. An idle process pays nothing (the tick
is gated by the very next large alloc/free).

`SeferAlloc::new()` is equivalent to
`SeferAlloc::with_config(LargeCacheConfig::DEFAULT)`. Want to set
values from env / CLI / a config file? Read them in your own code and
pass to the builder — the allocator is intentionally agnostic.

config is live: **[`docs/INTEGRATION.md`](docs/INTEGRATION.md)**.

## Two faces

`sefer-alloc` ships a second face over the same substrate — a typed
handle store for slot-storage use cases. Generational handles instead
of pointers; a stale handle returns `None`, never UB. This face needs
no features beyond the default:

```rust
use sefer_alloc::Region;

let mut region = Region::new();
let a = region.insert("alpha");
let b = region.insert("beta");

assert_eq!(region.get(a), Some(&"alpha"));

region.remove(a);
assert_eq!(region.get(a), None);          // stale handle → None, never UB
assert_eq!(region.get(b), Some(&"beta")); // others stay valid
```

For `no_std` + `alloc` targets, disable the `std` feature:
`sefer-alloc = { version = "0.3", default-features = false }`. The
default build is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` at the top; the only
`unsafe` comes from `slotmap`'s audited core wrapped by a thin typed
membrane.

The two faces share one substrate: SEGMENT-aligned (4 MiB) OS-backed
spans, self-hosted metadata (no `Vec` / `HashSet` / `std::alloc` on
any alloc path), per-thread heaps, non-intrusive cross-thread free
through a per-segment MPSC ring. See
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for the 30-minute tour.

Under `production`, the crate becomes `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` and every
`unsafe` lives in **seven named confined seams** (`alloc_core::{os,
node}` + `global::{sefer_alloc, tls_heap, fallback}` +
`registry::{heap_slot, heap_registry}`) — never in the alloc-path body
outside them. Each `unsafe` block carries a `// SAFETY:` proof; the
compiler enforces the confinement (a stray `unsafe` outside a named
seam is a hard error). Complete inventory:
[Where unsafe lives](#where-unsafe-lives-the-complete-list).

---

## Why bother

Two things, both rare in the same crate.

**Pure Rust, no C / C++ libraries pulled in.** Every comparable allocator in
the ecosystem wraps a C or C++ codebase: `mimalloc` (C++), `jemalloc`
(C, via `tikv-jemallocator`), `snmalloc` (C++), `tcmalloc` (C++). The most
common NUMA crates wrap `libnuma` (C). `sefer-alloc` is 100 % Rust — it
calls into the OS directly (`mmap` / `VirtualAlloc` / `mbind` etc. — the
same syscalls every allocator uses), but it does not link a single C or
C++ library. The only C dependency anywhere in this repository is the
optional `mimalloc` *dev*-dependency used as a baseline in benchmarks; it
is never on a consumer's runtime path. If a Rust-only build matrix matters
to you (cross-compilation, audit perimeter, supply-chain surface),
`sefer-alloc` is one of the few production-track choices.

**Safety claim is structural, not prose.** Most Rust allocators have
`unsafe` smeared across their hot paths and ask auditors to trust the
narrative. `sefer-alloc` makes the claim compiler-enforced: the default
build is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` at the top;
the moment any allocator feature (`experimental`, `alloc-core` and
above) is on, the crate switches to `#![deny(unsafe_code)]` and the
confined seams lift it with `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` only inside named
files. The compiler enforces it — a stray `unsafe` outside a named seam is
a hard error in every configuration. The intelligence (placement, free
lists, page maps, segment registries, bin tables, alloc bitmaps, owner
stamping, recycle policy) lives in pure safe integer arithmetic; the hand
(OS aperture, intrusive free-list r/w, NUMA syscalls, the
`unsafe impl GlobalAlloc` trait obligation, the TLS-binding raw-pointer
handoff, the heap-slot table) is split across small audited files.

The workspace extraction **improved the audit story** further: the two
OS-unsafe sub-problems (virtual-memory aperture and NUMA syscalls) are now
independently-publishable crates (`aligned-vmem` and `numa-shim`), each with
a single responsibility, a small line count, and their own `cargo test`. An
auditor who wants to verify the OS-memory unsafe can read those two crates
in isolation — they do not have to navigate the full allocator codebase.

The complete inventory by feature is in
[Where unsafe lives](#where-unsafe-lives-the-complete-list) below.

The performance is honest (numbers from a single Windows dev host with
criterion `sample_size(10)` — see [Performance](#performance) for the
disclaimer):

- On **large alloc/free** (`alloc_large` / `dealloc_large`) sefer-alloc is
  **~13–34× faster than `mimalloc`** (4/16/64 MiB) via the OPT-E large-segment
  cache — a 4 MiB cycle is ~58 ns vs mimalloc's ~779 ns, and ~309× faster than
  `System`.
- On **single-thread small-class churn** (the reuse pattern) it **beats
  `mimalloc`** at 16 B (1.26×), 64 B (1.23×), and 1024 B (5.8×); on cold
  first-touch of tiny blocks (16–64 B) mimalloc still leads — the documented
  worst-case, called out honestly in [`docs/ALLOC_BENCH.md`](docs/ALLOC_BENCH.md).
- On **realloc-grow under neighbour pressure** it is ~1.1× faster than
  `mimalloc` and ~8.8× faster than `System`.
- On **MT cross-thread** (`malloc_macro` larson/mstress) it is competitive
  with `mimalloc`, leading at T≥2 (historical 0.2.0 shape).

The verification stack is also honest: 88 integration test files, 8 loom
models, proptest differential against a reference model, miri with
strict-provenance, ThreadSanitizer (×3 clean runs), Valgrind memcheck (clean),
aarch64 (qemu), libFuzzer, soak / RSS / tokio-burn-in harnesses. The
[Verification evidence](#verification-evidence) section spells out what each
one actually proves.

         └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The same OS-backed segments serve both faces. The handle store reaches in via
the safe Cartographer (slot tables + generation checks); the global allocator
reaches in via the same Cartographer plus the documented `unsafe impl
GlobalAlloc` aperture. The Hand is always the same three modules — there is
no second copy of `mmap` somewhere else in the crate.

### Three organs

| Organ | Responsibility | Safety |
|---|---|---|
| **Cartographer** | All placement / free-list / page-map / segment-registry / bin-table / alloc-bitmap / decommit-policy / NUMA-preference logic. Pure integer arithmetic over indices and offsets. Never touches raw memory. | safe |
| **Membrane** | The typed APIs (`Handle<T>`, `Region<T>`, `AllocCore::alloc`, `SeferAlloc::alloc`). Total — cannot express UB at the type level. | safe |
| **Hand** | The confined-`unsafe` seams that touch raw memory. Each is a single audited file; every `unsafe { ... }` block carries a `// SAFETY:` proof. | confined |

The deliberate inversion: all the intelligence lives in the safe Cartographer,
so the Hand stays mechanical and small. Verification is over a total Membrane
and an integer algorithm, not a tangle of pointer math.

### Workspace: four independently-publishable companion crates

The workspace extracted four building blocks. Each is a real crates.io crate
someone can `cargo add` on its own — they are not internal implementation
details but independently useful libraries:

```
sefer-alloc
 ├── sefer-region    (crates/region)       — typed handle store (Handle<T>/Region<T>)
 ├── aligned-vmem    (crates/vmem)         — OS virtual-memory aperture  (feature: alloc-core)
 ├── numa-shim       (crates/numa)         — NUMA detection + binding    (feature: numa-aware)
 └── malloc-bench-rs (crates/malloc-bench) — portable GlobalAlloc bench harness (standalone)
```

`malloc-bench-rs` is not in sefer-alloc's runtime dependency tree — it exists
for anyone who wants to benchmark their own `GlobalAlloc` implementation.

Per-crate status:

| crate | crates.io | docs.rs |
|---|---|---|
| `sefer-region` | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/sefer-region.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/sefer-region) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/sefer-region/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/sefer-region) |
| `aligned-vmem` | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/aligned-vmem.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/aligned-vmem) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/aligned-vmem/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/aligned-vmem) |
| `numa-shim` | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/numa-shim.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/numa-shim) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/numa-shim/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/numa-shim) |
| `malloc-bench-rs` | [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/malloc-bench-rs.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/malloc-bench-rs) | [![Documentation](https://docs.rs/malloc-bench-rs/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/malloc-bench-rs) |

### Where `unsafe` lives (the complete list)

The extraction **improved the audit story**, not just reorganised code.
An auditor who wants to verify the OS-memory unsafe no longer has to read
through a large general-purpose allocator crate — they can audit `aligned-vmem`
(~400 lines, sole purpose: OS aperture) and `numa-shim` (~300 lines, sole
purpose: NUMA syscalls) in complete isolation. Each has one responsibility,
one reason to have `unsafe`, and its own `cargo test`.

Source of truth: `grep -rln 'allow(unsafe_code)' src/ crates/`

**External publishable crates (each independently auditable):**

| Crate | Path | Unsafe story |
|---|---|---|
| `aligned-vmem` | `crates/vmem/` | `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` — entire crate IS the OS aperture (`mmap`/`VirtualAlloc`/decommit); single responsibility, small, audit in isolation |
| `numa-shim` | `crates/numa/` | `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` — entire crate IS the NUMA syscall shim (`mbind`/`VirtualAllocExNuma`); single responsibility, small, audit in isolation |
| `malloc-bench-rs` | `crates/malloc-bench/` | `#![allow(unsafe_code)]` — confined to `alloc_block`/`free_block`/`drain_mailbox` helpers; every block carries `// SAFETY:` |
| `sefer-region` | `crates/region/` | `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` — zero own `unsafe`; `slotmap`'s audited core owns the generational layout |

**Internal sefer-alloc seams** (compiler-enforced — a stray `unsafe` outside
these named files is a hard compile error in every configuration):

| Module | What it owns | Loaded under |
|---|---|---|
| [`src/alloc_core/os.rs`](src/alloc_core/os.rs) | Thin interop wrapper around `aligned-vmem`; delegates SEGMENT-aligned reservation and decommit/recommit | `alloc-core` |
| [`src/alloc_core/node.rs`](src/alloc_core/node.rs) | Intrusive free-list node r/w through raw pointers (the generalised "hand" discipline); also `release_segment` thin wrapper | `alloc-core` |
| [`src/alloc_core/numa.rs`](src/alloc_core/numa.rs) | Thin interop wrapper around `numa-shim`; delegates NUMA-node query and segment binding | `numa-aware` |
| [`src/global/sefer_alloc.rs`](src/global/sefer_alloc.rs) | The `unsafe impl GlobalAlloc` alloc-face seam — the trait obligation + pointer handoff to the `Heap` | `alloc-global` |
| [`src/global/tls_heap.rs`](src/global/tls_heap.rs) | Raw-pointer TLS binding + `AbandonGuard` seam — the `*mut HeapCore` handoff under the single-writer invariant; `unsafe fn recycle` / `abandon_segments` from the guard's drop | `alloc-global` |
| [`src/global/fallback.rs`](src/global/fallback.rs) | The primordial fallback heap — `static mut MaybeUninit<HeapCore>` + atomic-init state-machine + spinlock-guarded `&mut` handout (so the global allocator survives reentrant / early-init / teardown access) | `alloc-global` |
| [`src/registry/heap_slot.rs`](src/registry/heap_slot.rs) | `Sync`/`Send` impls on `HeapSlot` under the atomic single-writer protocol; the slot's `UnsafeCell` hand-off | `alloc-global` |
| [`src/registry/heap_registry.rs`](src/registry/heap_registry.rs) | The global heap slot-table — the `*mut HeapCore` pointer handoff out of a slot, used by every cross-thread routing decision | `alloc-global` |
| [`src/concurrent/hand.rs`](src/concurrent/hand.rs) | The legacy epoch-tier `AtomicSlot<T>` (older experimental concurrent tier; superseded by `alloc-xthread` for the global allocator path; **deprecated**) | `experimental` |

Under the recommended `production` feature
(`alloc-global + alloc-xthread + alloc-decommit`) the active internal seams
are eight — `alloc_core::{os, node}` plus `global::{sefer_alloc, tls_heap,
fallback}` plus `registry::{heap_slot, heap_registry}`. `alloc-xthread` and
`alloc-decommit` themselves do **not** open new `unsafe` seams — they extend
existing safe code paths.

`numa-aware` adds one more internal seam (`alloc_core::numa`), which in turn
delegates to the independently-auditable `numa-shim` crate. `experimental`
opens the older research-tier concurrent seam (now deprecated); the production
build does not pull it in.

That's the full list. Everywhere else in the crate is forbidden / denied
`unsafe`; a stray `unsafe` outside these files is a hard compile error in
every configuration.

### The segment substrate (Phase 8)

Each segment is `SEGMENT = 4 MiB` of OS-backed, SEGMENT-aligned virtual
memory. The first metadata page hosts: a `SegmentHeader` (kind, magic, bump
cursor, owner state, NUMA node id, live-count); a `page_map` (one byte per
page, per-page descriptor); a `BinTable` (per-size-class free-list heads);
an `AllocBitmap` (1 bit per `MIN_BLOCK` slot, the O(1) double-free guard); a
`RemoteFreeRing` (the per-segment MPSC ring for cross-thread frees).

A self-hosted `SegmentTable` carved from the **primordial** segment indexes
every live segment by base pointer. It is **append-only with NULL-slot
recycle** under `alloc-decommit` (see [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §3`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md))
and from `0.1.0` ships an **open-addressing hash side-index** for O(1)
`contains_base` at DBMS scale. There is no `Vec` / `HashSet` / `std::alloc`
on any alloc path — M5 reentrancy-freedom is upheld structurally.

### Per-thread heaps and the lock-free fast path

A thread allocates from its own `Heap`'s per-class `BinTable` via a single
pointer read; deallocates with a single pointer write through the `node`
seam. No lock, no atomic on the common case. Slow path: refill `REFILL_BATCH
= 31` blocks from the current segment (the constant is **measured** — see
commit `81fec54`, bigger refills hurt locality).

Cross-thread free (opt-in `alloc-xthread`) does **not** dereference the
block: the freer pushes `(offset | class)` into the segment's
`RemoteFreeRing` (whose memory lives in metadata pages that are never
decommitted), and the owner reclaims lazily on its alloc-slow-path. The
freer stamps the class because the `page_map` is unreliable for mixed-class
pages produced by a shared bump cursor — the §13 race investigation
([`docs/RACE_DRAIN_RECLAIM.md`](docs/RACE_DRAIN_RECLAIM.md)) traced this
through four iterations of "peeling" before identifying the true root.

### Decommit (Phase 35) and large-cache (OPT-E)

When a small segment's live-count drops to zero AND it is not the current
carve target, payload pages are returned to the OS (`madvise MADV_DONTNEED`
/ `VirtualFree MEM_DECOMMIT`); the segment is reset to a clean blank,
re-committed on first reuse. **No epoch reclamation (M11) is needed** —
the four-point safety argument is recorded in
[`docs/PHASE35_DECOMMIT_DESIGN.md §1`](docs/PHASE35_DECOMMIT_DESIGN.md):
Variant-2 cross-thread free dissolves the only reason epoch was ever
considered.

`OPT-E` adds a small fixed-slot cache (`LARGE_CACHE_SLOTS = 8` slots, no
fixed per-span size cap — governed instead by the configurable
`LargeCacheConfig::budget_bytes`, default unbounded) inside each `AllocCore`
that holds freed large-segment OS reservations and reuses them on the next
`alloc_large` of comparable size — **without** decommitting and
re-committing pages, so the hit path is a `register` + header rewrite
(~42 ns at 4 MiB instead of 254 µs).

### NUMA-aware path (opt-in `numa-aware`)

The same hot path stamps `SegmentHeader::node_id` to the current thread's
NUMA node when `numa-aware` is on, and `find_segment_with_free` prefers
local-node segments with foreign-node fallback. The OS syscalls live in
[`src/alloc_core/numa.rs`](src/alloc_core/numa.rs) (Linux `mbind` via
`syscall(2)`, no `libnuma` dependency; Windows `VirtualAllocExNuma`;
macOS / miri no-op). Honest caveat: a QEMU `-numa` topology verifies
correctness, not latency-asymmetry — that needs real 2-socket hardware
(AWS `*.metal`, Graviton, dual-socket dev box). See
[`docs/PHASE_NUMA_DESIGN.md`](docs/PHASE_NUMA_DESIGN.md).

## Performance

**sefer-alloc 0.3.0, re-measured 2026-07-03** (criterion benches on a single
Windows dev host, `SeferAlloc` called directly through its `GlobalAlloc` impl
— apples-to-apples — vs `mimalloc 0.1` vs `System`). Per
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) the project's bench profile is the quick one —
`sample_size(10)`, short warm-up — and the host is noisy (±15–20 %), so these
are honest **comparative** measurements, **not** a rigorous statistical suite.
Trust the relative shape and the order of magnitude, not the exact percentages;
the rigorous, deterministic gate is the instruction-count `perf_gate_iai` bench
(#127/#128) on Linux CI. Source-of-truth tables + per-bench commentary live in
[`docs/ALLOC_BENCH.md`](docs/ALLOC_BENCH.md); re-run
`cargo bench --features production` for your own numbers. **Lower is better**
(latency).

### Large alloc / free (`benches/large_realloc.rs`, headline)

`alloc(N) + free` round-trip served by the OPT-E large-cache
(`alloc-decommit`): the freed segment is parked in the `LARGE_CACHE_SLOTS = 8`
cache with pages kept committed, so the next alloc of a compatible size
returns it with **no OS round-trip**. This is the crate's flagship strength.

| Workload | SeferAlloc | mimalloc | System | vs mimalloc | vs System |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `alloc(4 MiB) + free`  | **~58 ns** | ~779 ns  | ~18.0 µs | **~13× faster** | **~309× faster** |
| `alloc(16 MiB) + free` | **~63 ns** | ~890 ns  | ~15.3 µs | **~14× faster** | **~242× faster** |
| `alloc(64 MiB) + free` | **~62 ns** | ~2.14 µs | ~18.3 µs | **~34× faster** | **~295× faster** |

The cache is byte-budget'd (per-shard, default unbounded — set via
`LargeCacheConfig::new().budget_bytes(n)` in `SeferAlloc::with_config` to cap
it, where `budget_bytes(0)` disables caching), with lazy 10 %/sec exponential
decay back to `live + headroom`. There is no per-span size cap — a 30 GB
segment on a 64 GB box is cacheable now. The 0.3.0 `span_usable` fix (#134)
keeps this win without unbounded RSS amplification across cache reuse.

### Realloc grow under adversarial neighbour pressure

| Bench | SeferAlloc | mimalloc | System | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `realloc_grow_geometric` (64 B→4 MiB) | **~323 µs** | ~360 µs | ~2.85 ms | ~1.1× faster than mimalloc; **~8.8× faster than System** |
| `realloc_in_place_unfavorable`        | ~1.68 ms   | ~1.55 ms | ~8.15 ms | ~1.1× slower than mimalloc; **~4.9× faster than System** |

### Small-class churn vs cold direct (`benches/global_alloc.rs`)

Two patterns. **Churn** (steady-state over a live working set — each iteration
frees a pseudo-random slot and allocates a replacement) is the common shape of
real workloads and what the `fastbin` per-thread magazine
([`docs/FASTBIN_DESIGN.md`](docs/FASTBIN_DESIGN.md)) targets; the 0.3.0 #133
fix (removing a contended global `lock xadd` from the hit path) lifted 16/64 B
here ~20 %. **Cold direct** (no reuse, "first touch") is the documented
worst-case where mimalloc's cheaper first-touch path leads at tiny sizes.

| Size | Churn: Sefer | mimalloc | vs mi | Cold direct: Sefer | mimalloc | vs mi |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|   16 B | **~29 µs** | ~37 µs  | **1.26× faster** | ~28 µs | ~11 µs | 2.6× slower |
|   64 B | **~31 µs** | ~38 µs  | **1.23× faster** | ~29 µs | ~14 µs | 2.0× slower |
|  256 B | ~28 µs     | ~23 µs  | 1.25× slower     | ~28 µs | ~19 µs | 1.5× slower |
| 1024 B | **~28 µs** | ~161 µs | **5.8× faster**  | ~29 µs | ~35 µs | **1.2× faster** |

(All small-size rows are per-iteration batches; the same batch runs for all
three allocators, so the ratios are the meaningful signal. vs `System`: 3–6×
faster across the board.)

### MT cross-thread (`examples/malloc_macro.rs`, larson + mstress)

**Historical 0.2.0 numbers** — the MT macro-benchmarks were NOT re-run for
0.3.0 this pass (the single-thread criterion tables above were); the crossover
shape (mimalloc leads at T=1, SeferAlloc leads at T≥2) is expected to hold but
the exact figures are not current-build. Aggregate million-ops/sec (op = one
alloc + one free), T = 1 / 2 / 4 worker threads, unpinned.

Aggregate million-ops/sec (op = one alloc + one free), T = 1 / 2 / 4
worker threads, unpinned.

**larson** (server-churn, working-set + occasional cross-thread free):

| T | SeferAlloc | mimalloc | System | vs mimalloc |
|--:|-----------:|---------:|-------:|------------:|
| 1 | ~20.5 M | ~27.9 M | ~6.9 M | **1.36× slower** |
| 2 | ~23.2 M | ~18.2 M | ~6.8 M | **1.28× faster** |
| 4 | ~39.4 M | ~32.5 M | ~13.4 M | **1.21× faster** |

**mstress** (rounds of fill → free-half → refill, with cross-thread):

| T | SeferAlloc | mimalloc | System | vs mimalloc |
|--:|-----------:|---------:|-------:|------------:|
| 1 | ~26.6 M | ~34.0 M | ~4.1 M | **1.28× slower** |
| 2 | ~44.7 M | ~37.6 M | ~6.2 M | **1.19× faster** |
| 4 | ~84.1 M | ~64.0 M | ~13.5 M | **1.31× faster** |

`SeferAlloc` overtakes `mimalloc` at T ≥ 2 on both workloads (the
per-thread heap takes no shared lock; cross-thread frees route through
the lock-free Phase-10/12.6 remote path). Single-thread (T = 1) `mimalloc`
leads — see the verdict below.

### Synthetic bulk worst case (`benches/global_alloc.rs::global_alloc`)

`alloc 1024 → free 1024` — the documented worst case for any per-thread
magazine (every free overflows; every alloc empties and refills). Kept as
a regression guard, **not** a representative workload.

| Size | SeferAlloc | mimalloc | vs mimalloc |
|---|---|---|---|
|   16 B | ~29.4 µs | ~10.3 µs | 2.87× slower |
|   64 B | ~30.3 µs | ~13.7 µs | 2.21× slower |
|  256 B | ~30.8 µs | ~16.8 µs | 1.83× slower |
| 1024 B | ~32.0 µs | ~33.3 µs | parity |

A bulk-mode bypass (detect alloc-without-free streak, skip the magazine)
would close this; for now it is the documented design trade-off of
`fastbin` (default-on in `production`). Disable `fastbin` if your primary
workload is arena-style bulk alloc-then-bulk-free.

Reproduce with:

```bash
cargo bench --bench large_realloc --features "alloc-global alloc-decommit" -- large_alloc_free
cargo bench --bench global_alloc  --features production -- global_alloc_churn
cargo bench --bench global_alloc  --features production -- "^global_alloc/"
cargo run   --release --example malloc_macro --features "alloc-global alloc-xthread"
```

### Honest verdict

- **Where sefer-alloc wins big:**
  - **Large alloc/free OPT-E:** 16–39× faster than `mimalloc`, 270–380× faster
    than `System`. The headline.
  - **Real-world churn (the common shape):** 1.7× on 16/64 B, parity on 256 B,
    **7.3× on 1024 B**.
  - **Realloc** (`realloc_in_place_unfavorable`): 10.5× via OPT-F skip-copy.
  - **MT macro at T ≥ 2:** larson 1.21–1.28×, mstress 1.19–1.31× faster.
- **Where it ties:** churn 256 B; bulk 1024 B; MT mstress T = 2 within noise.
- **Where it loses:**
  - **Single-thread larson/mstress T = 1:** 1.28–1.36× behind `mimalloc`.
    Structural cost of our safety machinery (M2 double-free guard on the
    bitmap, `contains_base` foreign-pointer hash probe, cross-thread routing
    reads on every `dealloc`) — the inline-seam (#101/#102) is fully exhausted;
    closing further requires changing M2 mechanics. See
    [`docs/FASTBIN_DESIGN.md`](docs/FASTBIN_DESIGN.md) §0 and the "what's left"
    section.
  - **Synthetic bulk (16–256 B alloc-1024-then-free-1024):** 1.8–2.9× slower —
    the magazine's design worst case (every free overflows, every alloc
    empties and refills). Documented trade-off; not a real-world pattern.

Every loss above is the price of a safety guarantee `mimalloc` does not
provide (double-free = no-op, never UB; foreign pointer = safe no-op;
forbid(unsafe) at the top level with one audited `unsafe` aperture). On
real workloads — churn, MT, large-alloc — we are net faster while keeping
those guarantees.

## Verification evidence

This is a verification-first build. Every claim above is backed by a tool,
a test file, and a reproducible command. **88 integration test files** ship
in `tests/` (80 conventional + 8 loom models — counted separately below);
**5 example binaries** in `examples/`; **9 benches** in `benches/`
(`global_alloc`, `heap_alloc`, `heap_async_pattern`, `heap_xthread`,
`large_realloc`, `locality`, `perf_gate_iai`, `pinned_write`, `sharded_write`);
**2 libFuzzer targets** in `fuzz/`
(`region_ops`, `global_alloc_ops`).

| Tool | What it proves | Where in repo |
|---|---|---|
| Unit / integration tests | Construction, edge cases, end-to-end behaviour | `tests/*.rs` (88 files) |
| `proptest` differential | Op-stream agreement with a reference model (M1–M4) | `tests/alloc_core_differential.rs`, `tests/differential.rs` |
| `loom` | Cross-thread protocol agreement (Phase 12, Phase 10) — honest status per file (some model live paths, some are retained-with-honesty-notes on removed/dead paths) in each file's own doc comment | `tests/loom_xthread_protocol.rs`, `loom_remote_ring.rs`, `loom_thread_free.rs`, `loom_registry.rs`, `loom_sharded.rs`, `loom_epoch.rs`, `loom_bootstrap_cas.rs`, `loom_fallback_init.rs` (8 models) |
| `miri` (strict-provenance) | UAF, races at byte level, double-free, exposed-provenance casts | CI gate: `region_invariants`, `decommit_miri_cycle`, `reclaim_offset_unit` |
| ThreadSanitizer | Real cross-thread data races on a live binary | CI job + manual ×3 verified clean on `race_repro`, `race_norecycle`, `global_alloc_mt`, `heap_cross_thread`, `decommit_stale_ring`, `decommit_soak` |
| Valgrind `memcheck` | UAF, leaks, invalid reads at the process level | Manual: clean on all three cross-thread test binaries. Note: `helgrind` / `DRD` are inapplicable to lock-free atomic code (Valgrind doesn't model Rust atomics) — TSan is the right concurrency detector here. |
| aarch64 via `qemu-user` | Code-gen + relaxed-memory smoke on ARM | CI job + manual 13/13 tests pass. Honest caveat: TCG translation does not fully model ARM's weak-memory; real ARM hardware verification is a follow-up. |
| libFuzzer | Op-stream invariants under random input | `fuzz/fuzz_targets/region_ops.rs`, `global_alloc_ops.rs` |
| Soak harness | N-thread × hours stability | `examples/soak_xthread.rs` (32 / 64 / 128 workers) |
| tokio burn-in | Live `#[global_allocator]` under tokio multi-thread runtime | `examples/tokio_burn_in.rs` |
| RSS probe | Memory recovery under asymmetric cross-thread pressure | `examples/rss_probe.rs` |
| Macro-bench | MT throughput vs `mimalloc` and System | `examples/malloc_macro.rs` (larson + mstress) |
| Flamegraph profiling | Hot path identification per workload | `docs/PROFILE_FLAMEGRAPHS.md` (4 scenarios) |

Every CI job is wired (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and runs on every push:
test matrix on x86_64 + aarch64, six feature combinations, miri with
strict-provenance, ThreadSanitizer, libFuzzer build, clippy, rustfmt.

The full safety stack and the relationship between layers is documented in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md §8`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
[`docs/INVARIANTS.md`](docs/INVARIANTS.md).

## Features matrix

| Feature | Pulls in | What it enables | Default | When to use |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `std` | — | `SyncRegion`, all `std`-gated tiers | **on** | almost always |
| `alloc-core` | `std` | The segment substrate (`AllocCore`) | off | building on `AllocCore` directly |
| `alloc` | `alloc-core` | Per-thread `Heap` + intrusive free lists | off | single-thread allocator |
| `alloc-xthread` | `alloc` | Lock-free cross-thread free via `RemoteFreeRing` | off | multi-thread allocator |
| `alloc-global` | `alloc` | The `SeferAlloc` `#[global_allocator]` face | off | process-wide allocator |
| `alloc-decommit` | `alloc-core` | Return empty-segment payload pages to OS + `SegmentTable` slot-recycle | off | long-running / DBMS workloads |
| `numa-aware` | `alloc-core` | NUMA-node stamping + local-node preference (Linux `mbind`, Windows `VirtualAllocExNuma`) | off | multi-socket NUMA hardware |
| **`production`** | `alloc-global + alloc-xthread + alloc-decommit` | **The recommended combo for long-running multi-thread workloads.** | off | **DBMS, async runtimes, anything that allocates over hours.** |
| `experimental` | `std` + deps | Lock-free `LockFreeRegion` / `EpochRegion` / `ShardedRegion` (legacy/deprecated; kept for backward compat and research baseline) | off | RCU / epoch experiments only |
| `pinning` | `experimental` + `core_affinity` | Thread-per-core pinning with `core_affinity` (`PinnedRunner` is NOT deprecated) | off | `shard == core` workloads |

`production` is the right starting point for almost any multi-thread or
async use of `SeferAlloc`. Without `alloc-decommit` the `SegmentTable`
slot-recycle is off and the 1024-segment ceiling is a hard cap — a tokio
server with hundreds of tasks will eventually OOM. For embedded / `no_std`
use, stay with the default `std` feature.

### Tuning the large-segment cache (`alloc-decommit`)

The `alloc-decommit` feature carries a per-thread large-segment free-cache.
Configuration is via the `LargeCacheConfig` const builder — all knobs are
set at compile time in a `static` initialiser; no environment reads, no
runtime parse errors.

| Builder method | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `budget_bytes(n)` | `None` (**unbounded**) | Per-shard ceiling on total cached bytes. `0` = cache disabled (every span released to the OS immediately). **Unset = no admission limit**; FIFO eviction fires only when this is set and the new span would exceed it. |
| `decay_rate_percent(n)` | `10` (10 %/tick) | Integer percent of `excess = cached − headroom` to release back to the OS per tick. Range `[1, 100]`, clamped. |
| `decay_interval_ms(n)` | `1000` (1 s) | Minimum wall-clock ms between two consecutive decay ticks. A tick fires inline on the next large alloc/free after the interval elapsed. Idle processes pay nothing. |
| `headroom_bytes(n)` | `256 MiB` | Floor below which the decay is a no-op (anti-thrashing pad). |
| `mode(m)` | `LargeCacheMode::Lazy` | `Lazy` (default) / `Background` / `Both`. `Background` and `Both` are reserved for a future background scavenger thread; currently behave identically to `Lazy`. |

The model is "**allocate fast, release slowly**": on a large `free`, the
span is admitted to the cache (subject to budget); on each subsequent large
op, the excess over `headroom` exponentially decays to the OS at the chosen
rate. Self-damping: aggressive far from target, gentle near target, no
oscillation. The default `budget=None` (unbounded) admits any span; if you
want a hard RSS ceiling (containers, mobile), add
`.budget_bytes(512 * 1024 * 1024)` to your config (or whatever fits).

## Honest limitations

- **Single-thread small-class hot path is ~1.2–2× behind `mimalloc`.** The
  flamegraph at [`docs/PROFILE_FLAMEGRAPHS.md §1`](docs/PROFILE_FLAMEGRAPHS.md)
  shows where; OPT-C lazy stamp recovers ~1 %, the structural gap remains.
- **NUMA latency-speedup is not benchmarked on real hardware.** QEMU
  `-numa` verifies correctness, not asymmetry. Real measurement needs a
  2-socket dev box / cloud `.metal` instance — flagged in
  [`docs/PHASE_NUMA_DESIGN.md`](docs/PHASE_NUMA_DESIGN.md).
- **ARM weak-memory is partial coverage.** aarch64 13/13 under `qemu-user`
  proves code-gen + most race-conditions; TCG does not fully model ARM's
  weak memory. Verification on real ARM hardware (Graviton / Apple Silicon
  / Raspberry Pi) is a follow-up.
- **Valgrind helgrind / DRD are inapplicable.** Both report thousands of
  false positives on legitimate lock-free atomic load/store pairs (Valgrind
  does not model Rust atomics). `ThreadSanitizer` is the right concurrency
  detector for this codebase. Valgrind `memcheck` is run and clean.
- **The large-cache has no fixed per-span size cap.** The old
  `MAX_CACHED_LARGE_BYTES = 64 MiB` ceiling was removed (#90); admission is
  governed by `LargeCacheConfig::budget_bytes` (default `None` — unbounded)
  and the fixed `LARGE_CACHE_SLOTS = 8` slot count, not by span size. A
  workload with sustained multi-GB large allocations is cacheable subject to
  the configured budget (or the process's available RSS, if unbounded).
- **`alloc-decommit` is opt-in.** Without it, slot-recycle is off and the
  1024-segment cap is a hard ceiling for cumulative segment registrations.
  Use the `production` feature alias to avoid this.

## MSRV

**1.88.** The single-threaded core is plain safe Rust and will build on
much older toolchains; we pin a known-good floor from day one. MSRV bumps
are minor releases.

## Contributing

PRs welcome — please read [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) first. The
short version: this is a verification-first project, so a PR is expected
to come with tests + run the right verification layer for what it changes
(`cargo test --features production` minimum; miri / loom / TSan for
cross-thread; `// SAFETY:` for any new `unsafe`).

The codebase conventions are documented in
[`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) and `CLAUDE.md` (one
export per file; `mod.rs` only re-exports; tests live in `tests/` not
inline; `unsafe` only in named seams). The compiler enforces the unsafe
discipline; the rest is convention.

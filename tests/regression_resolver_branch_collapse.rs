//! Task #145 (Э2) — "two sentinels, one branch" regression.
//!
//! The three TLS resolvers in `global::tls_heap`
//! (`current`/`current_for_alloc`/`current_for_alloc_with_config`) used to
//! match `p == TORN`, then `p == null`, then the real-pointer case — two
//! compares against the two sentinels on the process's hottest path. Э2
//! collapses the hot check to ONE unsigned compare:
//!
//! ```text
//! p.addr().wrapping_sub(1) < usize::MAX - 1
//! ```
//!
//! which is TRUE for every real pointer (addr in `1..=MAX-1` ⇒ `addr-1` in
//! `0..=MAX-2`, all `< MAX-1`) and FALSE for both sentinels:
//!   - null  (addr 0):   `0.wrapping_sub(1) = MAX`   → NOT `< MAX-1` → cold
//!   - TORN  (addr MAX): `MAX-1`                     → NOT `< MAX-1` → cold
//!
//! The cold arm then splits on the exact value: null → bind a real slot
//! (`Own`), TORN → `Fallback`. The observable mapping is byte-identical to the
//! old three-arm match:
//!   - a real cached pointer      → `Own`   (fast path)
//!   - first-ever call (null)     → bind → `Own`
//!   - post-teardown (TORN)       → `Fallback`
//!
//! This test pins BOTH cold mappings:
//!   1. **null → bind → real** — a FRESH thread (its `LOCAL` starts null) that
//!      allocates must succeed and resolve to a real own-heap slot (it never
//!      routes to fallback just because `LOCAL` was null). Exercised
//!      indirectly: a fresh thread doing real allocations that all succeed.
//!   2. **TORN → Fallback** — the #129 `#[doc(hidden)]` hook (which pokes the
//!      exact `mark_local_torn` the teardown path uses) must still resolve to
//!      `Fallback`. If the branch collapse mis-mapped TORN (e.g. treated it as
//!      a real pointer because the single compare was wrong), the hook would
//!      report `Own(TORN)` and this fails.
//!
//! Counterfactual: an incorrect collapse — e.g. `<= usize::MAX - 1` (which
//! would let TORN through as "real") or `< usize::MAX` (which would let null's
//! wrapped `MAX` through) — makes one of the two assertions below fail.

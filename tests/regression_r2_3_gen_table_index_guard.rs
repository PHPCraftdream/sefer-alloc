//! R2-3 regression: `gen_at` rejects an out-of-range payload offset via a
//! RELEASE-surviving index guard.
//!
//! `gen_at(base, off)` (and `bump_gen`, `init_gen_table_in_place`) materialise
//! an atomic view into the segment's generation table at
//! `base + gen_table_off + (off >> MIN_BLOCK_SHIFT)` and load/RMW it. They
//! carried only a `debug_assert!(idx < GEN_TABLE_FOOTPRINT)` guard, which
//! COMPILES OUT in release builds — so in a release build an out-of-range `off`
//! read/wrote past the table unguarded (round2 finding R2-3 / cleanup#2).
//!
//! ## The fix
//!
//! The `debug_assert!` is now a release-surviving `assert!`. This module is
//! `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` AND `gen_at`/`bump_gen` have internal callers
//! across OTHER `forbid` files (`alloc_core_small.rs`, `bootstrap.rs`,
//! `heap_core.rs`) that cannot host `unsafe` blocks — so the
//! `heap_registry`-style `unsafe fn` discipline (T1, commit ce887e5) cannot
//! apply. A runtime index guard is the soundness fix; base validity stays the
//! caller's contract (documented), exactly as for the `Node` seam primitives
//! these delegate to.
//!
//! ## RED→GREEN
//!
//! In a RELEASE build: before the fix `debug_assert!` compiled out, so
//! `gen_at(base, SEGMENT)` read one-past the table (the address stays inside
//! the mapped segment, so it returned a garbage byte rather than crashing) —
//! RED. After the fix the `assert!` panics — GREEN. Debug-only distinction is
//! impossible (`debug_assert!` already panicked in debug); run with `--release`.

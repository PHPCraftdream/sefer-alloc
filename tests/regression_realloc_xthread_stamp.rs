//! Regression test for MUST-1 (0.3.0, C2 regression) —
//! `HeapCore::realloc`'s own-segment branch used to delegate STRAIGHT to
//! `AllocCore::realloc` without applying the two ownership hooks that
//! `HeapCore::alloc` applies (segment-ownership stamping and the A1
//! deferred-large drain).
//!
//! ## What this guards against
//!
//! `AllocCore::realloc` internally `alloc`s a FRESH segment for the
//! non-in-place cases — a large→large grow carves a NEW dedicated Large
//! segment. Pre-fix, `HeapCore::realloc`'s own-segment branch was:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! if self.core.contains_base(base) {
//!     return self.core.realloc(ptr, old_layout, new_size);
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! so that freshly-carved segment's header was written with
//! `owner_thread_free == null` and NEVER stamped (stamping lives only in
//! `HeapCore::alloc`, not in `AllocCore`). Consequence: a Vec grown via
//! realloc on thread A lives in an unstamped Large segment; when A sends it
//! to thread B and B drops it, `dealloc_routing` sees not-ours + magic OK +
//! `owner_tf == null` → silent no-op → the whole 4+ MiB segment and its
//! `SegmentTable` slot leak forever (the resurrected A1/#114
//! leak-to-abort, on the everyday "Vec grows on one thread, freed on
//! another" pattern).
//!
//! Post-fix, `HeapCore::realloc`'s own-segment branch mirrors `alloc`'s two
//! hooks: it drains the deferred-large stack for a Large-classified new size
//! and stamps the realloc RESULT when it lands in a different (freshly
//! carved) segment. The grown pointer's segment is therefore stamped with
//! `owner_thread_free`, so a later cross-thread free routes back to the
//! owner via the deferred-free stack and the segment is reclaimed (counted
//! by `DBG_LARGE_XTHREAD_RECLAIMED`) on the owner's next large alloc.
//!
//! ## Counterfactual (non-vacuity)
//!
//! With the fix reverted (comment out the stamp/drain additions in
//! `HeapCore::realloc`'s own-segment branch), this test FAILS: the grown
//! segment is unstamped, the remote free no-ops, nothing is queued, and
//! `DBG_LARGE_XTHREAD_RECLAIMED`'s delta stays `0` after the owner's second
//! round of large allocations. This RED was verified by hand during
//! development.
//!
//! Feature-map: needs `--features production` (which enables both
//! `alloc-global` and `alloc-xthread`).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial scaffold of the `sefer-alloc` crate.
- Single-threaded `Region<T>` — a thin typed membrane over the
  [`slotmap`](https://crates.io/crates/slotmap) crate (`insert` / `get` /
  `get_mut` / `remove` / `contains` / `iter` / `clear`, all `O(1)`), built under
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; `slotmap`'s audited `unsafe` owns the dense
  generational engine, including version-saturation slot retirement.
- Typed, copyable `Handle<T>` — a newtype over `slotmap::DefaultKey` with
  hand-written `Copy`/`Eq`/`Hash`/`Debug` impls that hold for every `T`.
- Safety invariants I1–I5 documented (`docs/INVARIANTS.md`) and encoded as
  unit tests plus a proptest differential harness against a reference model
  (`tests/differential.rs`).
- Full detailed implementation plan — per-phase goals, deliverables, steps, and
  gates, plus dependency DAG, risk register, decisions log, and open questions
  (`docs/PLAN.md`) — alongside architecture notes (`docs/DESIGN.md`).
- Dual MIT / Apache-2.0 licensing; MSRV pinned to 1.88.

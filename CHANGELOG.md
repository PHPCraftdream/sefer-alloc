## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial scaffold of the `sefer-alloc` crate.
- Single-threaded `Region<T>` — a thin typed membrane over the
  [`slotmap`](https://crates.io/crates/slotmap) crate (`insert` / `get` /
  `get_mut` / `remove` / `contains` / `iter` / `clear`, all `O(1)`), built under
  `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`; `slotmap`'s audited `unsafe` owns the dense
  generational engine, including version-saturation slot retirement.
- Typed, copyable `Handle<T>` — a newtype over `slotmap::DefaultKey` with
  hand-written `Copy`/`Eq`/`Hash`/`Debug` impls that hold for every `T`.
- `SyncRegion<T>` — the always-shippable concurrent baseline: a
  `RwLock<Region<T>>` with a guard API plus one-shot convenience methods, with
  poison recovery, still `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`.
- `LockFreeRegion<T>` (behind the opt-in `experimental` feature) — **lock-free
  reads** via `arc-swap` RCU with page-granularity copy-on-write: readers load
  an immutable snapshot and resolve handles without any lock; rare writers
  serialise, copy only the touched page, and publish atomically. Values live
  behind `Arc<T>`; reclamation is plain `Arc` refcounting. **Zero `unsafe` of
  our own** — the crate stays `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]` with the feature on.
- `EpochRegion<T>` (behind `experimental`) — the fixed-capacity epoch tier with
  O(1) per-slot writes: lock-free reads via a seqlock-validated
  `(generation, value)` publication protocol and `crossbeam-epoch` reclamation.
  Introduces the crate's **single confined `unsafe` organ** (`concurrent::hand`,
  `AtomicSlot<T>`); confinement is compiler-enforced (`#![deny(unsafe_code)]`
  crate-wide under the feature, lifted only in that one module). The publication
  protocol is **loom-model-checked**; live values are dropped on region drop
  (I5). miri cannot run the tier only because `crossbeam-epoch`'s global
  collector is not miri-clean upstream — our `unsafe` is not implicated.
- `ByteRegion` and `ByteAllocator` (behind the research-flagged `byte` feature)
  — the descent to raw bytes: a size-classed free-list byte arena whose
  placement logic is pure safe integer arithmetic (the Cartographer), with the
  single irreducible `*mut u8` aperture confined and documented, plus an
  experimental `unsafe impl GlobalAlloc` delegating through a `Mutex`. The
  second confined-`unsafe` module; confinement stays compiler-enforced. The
  whole byte tier is **miri-clean**. Honest scope: it does not aim to beat the
  system allocator / `mimalloc` (see `docs/BYTE_BENCH.md`); resocks5's global
  allocator stays `mimalloc` regardless.
- Safety invariants I1–I5 documented (`docs/INVARIANTS.md`) and encoded as
  unit tests plus a proptest differential harness against a reference model
  (`tests/differential.rs`).
- Full detailed implementation plan — per-phase goals, deliverables, steps, and
  gates, plus dependency DAG, risk register, decisions log, and open questions
  (`docs/PLAN.md`) — alongside architecture notes (`docs/DESIGN.md`).
- Dual MIT / Apache-2.0 licensing; MSRV pinned to 1.88.
